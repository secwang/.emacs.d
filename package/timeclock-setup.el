;;; Commentary:

;;  Additions to timeclock.el and timeclock-x.el (timeclock-x-squared?).
;;  This does some simple set-up tasks, and includes some elisp glue
;;  to run perl utilities.

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'timeclock-setup)

;;; Code:

(provide 'timeclock-setup)
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl))
