#+TITLE: Example of attributes in org-opml

* Hello World
  :PROPERTIES:
  :name: helloWorld
  :created: Sat, 08 Mar 2014 23:32:38 GMT
  :END:

  Property nodes attached to a headline become <outline> attributes.

  Above, I've added two property nodes -- "name" and "created" --
  and set their respective values.

  Any property node provided will be attached as an <outline>
  attribute.

  You can quickly create a PROPERTIES drawer with `C-u C-c C-x d`.
